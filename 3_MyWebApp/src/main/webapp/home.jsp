<!-- webapp folder was created by us and the inside the same we created this file -->

<!-- For this page to run, we are required to go for below url
localhost:8080/home                                                            <= this is our req, and controller will call this request
but how we can go to the same, so for that, we require controller

that's why we are required to create src>main>HomeController.java -->

<!-- In MVC
we create a model
we create a view
we create a controller -->
